# REACT ENGINEER PRACTICAL TEST

The following app is the result of the technical test required for the selection process for a React Engineer developer.

The app consists of the following features:

- Main Library: react
- CSS FrameWork: mui
- State Handling: recoil
- HTTP Request: fetch API
- Router Library: react router dom
- Typescript

Regarding the architecture's app, it should be noted that it is determined by the framework used (react in this case). Then we can affirm that the app has a component-based architecture.
